# Excquisie-Corpse-Camilo
Create with others an exquisite corpse exercise

> "Exquisite corpse (from the original French term cadavre exquis, literally exquisite cadaver), is a method by which a collection of words or images is collectively assembled. Each collaborator adds to a composition in sequence, either by following a rule (e.g., "The adjective noun adverb verb the adjective noun." as in "The green duck sweetly sang the dreadful dirge.")[citation needed] or by being allowed to see only the end of what the previous person contributed."
